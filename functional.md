# Lambda Expressions:
- Introducing **lambda expressions** in JDK8 had a fundamental impact on java similar to that of generics. They added syntactic sugar that improved the expressive power of the language and eliminated some clunkiness of existing constructs. They also allowed for a better use of multi-core parallelism in the Java API, especially through the for-each operations and the *stream API*.
