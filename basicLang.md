# Types:
## Java Primitives:
- Java has 8 primitive types that can be grouped in the following 4 groups:
	- **Integers:** These are **byte**, **short**, **int** and**long**.
	- **Floats:** including **float** and **double**
	- **Chararacters:** **char**. 
	- **Booleans:** **boolean**.
- Without these primitives, Java would be 100% object-oriented. Java chose to keep these primitive to conserve the perforance that would've been severely degraded if these were made into java objects. 
- Java primitives ranges are strictly defined so they are the same in every system, making them much more portable than say C++ primitives though this has some effect on the performance.
